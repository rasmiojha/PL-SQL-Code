Explain the difference between PL/SQL and SQL.

SQL (Structured Query Language)
Nature: Declarative language.
Purpose: Primarily used for querying and manipulating data in relational databases.
Operations: Executes single queries at a time (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Control Structures: Does not support control structures like loops or conditionals directly.
Variables: Does not support variable declaration.
Error Handling: Limited error handling capabilities.
Use Case: Ideal for simple data retrieval and manipulation tasks.

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL)
Nature: Procedural language.
Purpose: Extends SQL with procedural capabilities, allowing for more complex programming.
Operations: Executes blocks of code, which can include multiple SQL statements and procedural logic.
Control Structures: Supports control structures like loops (FOR, WHILE) and conditionals (IF-THEN-ELSE).
Variables: Allows declaration of variables, constants, and data types.
Error Handling: Robust error handling with exception handling mechanisms.
Use Case: Suitable for developing complex business logic, stored procedures, and triggers123.
In summary, while SQL is excellent for straightforward data manipulation, PL/SQL provides the additional power needed for more complex and procedural tasks within the database.
